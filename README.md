Hi! This is the README file for my program. 
ullist.cpp/.h contains the implementation for an array bases linked list
split.cpp/.h contains an implementation of a function that will recursively split elements in a linked list to an odds and evens list.
Some little details about my implementation. 
The functions push_front/push_back on an empty array will just push to the first index. 
Program will create a new Item if push_front or push_back fills up the array.
